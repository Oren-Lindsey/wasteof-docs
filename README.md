# wasteof-docs
the "officially unofficial" wasteof.money developer documentation.

# what
a repository documentating nearly everything that a developer might want to know about wasteof.money.
the categories will hopefully guide you in the right direction into finding what you're looking for.

(note: "wasteof" is short for wasteof.money, in case you were confused about that.)

# why
mostly for two reasons, those being:
1. it gets exhausting trying to find new endpoints.
2. there wasn't any public documentation before [wasteof2-docs](https://github.com/wulliy/wasteof2-docs) came.

(while official documentation for the site was in the works, it was never finished and was never published.)

but also... it would be nice if there was a big hub that contain all the documentation about the different APIs used around the wasteof.money ecosystem.

# when
this project originally started in 2021 as a fun side project, just me and a text document in notepad listing down all of the endpoints i found along the way. then, i created the [wasteof2-docs](https://github.com/wulliy/wasteof2-docs) repository because managing a text document in notepad wasn't very fun and it was also very messy. after a little while, the [wasteof.money 3 beta](https://beta.wasteof.money) became public and so did [wasteof3-docs](https://github.com/wulliy/wasteof3-docs).

finally, i decided to scratch all of that and to instead make this, where all of the documentation would go instead of being seperated into several different repositories.

# where
in front of you.

# how
browser devtools, reverse engineering of the several sites, and generally taking notes.

# thanks
no problem.
