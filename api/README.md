# api 
THIS CATEGORY IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE!!
---
this category contains all of the documentation that you'll want for wasteof.money's APIs.

# notes
- most of these API endpoints do require that you pass a token into the `Authorization` header when making a request to them.
- any endpoints that has `__data.json` appended to the end of their URL is equivalent to making a request to the URL without `__data.json` at the end and instead setting the `Accept` header to `application/json`.
- [the beta API is mostly for internal use and as such it could change at any moment without a notice.][https://wasteof.money/posts/629eef086586aae544597fac]
