# api
this category contains all of the documentation that you'll probably want for wasteof.money's APIs.

# notes
- most of these API endpoints do require you to provide a token in the `Authorization` header when making a request to them.
- any endpoints that has `__data.json` appended to the end of their URL is equivalent to making a request to the URL with the `Accept` header set to `application/json`.
- the beta API is [mostly for internal use and as such it could change at any moment without notice](https://wasteof.money/posts/629eef086586aae544597fac).
- the [current wasteof2 API](https://api.wasteof.money) is considered to be legacy and will probably be changed soon, so be on the look out.
